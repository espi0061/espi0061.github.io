# How did I create my Portfolio Web Site?
    I created my portfolio web site using an html file for every web page to develop the website's structure, and a css file to stylize the web site according to the mock up's layout. Within the html files I included several divs so that it would be easier for me to apply different css properties like grid and flex. Within the img tags I added srcset and sizes attributes to make my web site's images more responsive so that unnecessary bandwidth won't be used, the web site will be able to load quicker, and users can get a more adequate image according to the size of the viewport of the technological device they are using. 

    In css I used mostly grid to develop the most complex layout sections on my web site. Grid was used mostly in my home page, portfolio page, travel blogs page, and photography blogs page. I also used css grid to develop the different footer's layout. However, when it comes to the nav, I used flex to develop its layout on tablet and desktop views. For this assignment I decided not to use Bootstrap.

    My biggest challenge was the height of images. They did not allow me to create the clean grids I had the intention to develop. Even though I got very closed to the grids I created on my XD mock-up, I was not able to align some of my grids' children properly.

    Despite of this unfortunate issue, I got more familiarized on how to develop grids using the appropiate code. I tend to use grid-template-areas property to create my grids more efficiently and quicker. Additionally, this is the first time I include css variables on a project and I noticed how easy and quickly it would be to make important changes on the site by making use of them. I used css variables on the web sites' colors, font family, and some major sizes.
