                My name is Santiago Espinosa Lizcano, and I am 20 years old. I was born in April 14<sup>th</sup> 2000,
                in Bogota, Colombia. I graduated from high school in 2017, and then decided to take a great adventure to
                travel to the United States where I ended up studying Business Administration. Currently, my adventured
                followed up in Canada where I am studying <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>
                There are lot of thing and hobbies I enjoy doing. I love playing soccer. In fact, I played a
                <em>national tournament</em> in my home country. I also like learning languages. I am currently working
                my way to learn <em>Portuguese and French</em>. As I final though, I would like to share with you a
                quote that has inspired me throughout the years.
            </p>
